"""Regression for the streaming-body OOM (benchmark-17 audit bug #1).

Before the fix the feeder used `std::sync::mpsc` — unbounded. A fast
client could dump 10 GB of upload body into the channel faster than a
slow Python handler drained it, trashing RAM.

Now the feeder uses `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(CHANNEL_CAPACITY)` and
`.send().await`, which propagates backpressure to `poll_frame` → TCP
window → client.

The full DoS test needs a multi-GB-per-second peer that's not easy to
simulate in pytest; instead we verify functional correctness (the
handler still receives every chunk) and that the critical
backpressure primitive is present in the source.
