"""Regression for the eager-eval DOS (audit round 5 bug #1).

Before the fix, `handle_request_subinterp` collected the entire
request body (up to `max_body_size`, default 10 MB) *before* checking
if the worker channel could accept. A flood of concurrent uploads
could pile N × max_body_size into RAM while each request waited for
a full queue — 5000 × 10 MB = 50 GB, OOM'd.

Now a `tokio::sync::Semaphore` on `InterpreterPool` is acquired
*before* the body collect. No permit → 503 Overloaded, body stays
in the kernel TCP buffer.

We verify the submit_semaphore is structurally wired in (the permit
is acquired in the right place) and that the permit lifecycle
defaults are correct. A true DOS simulation needs real traffic.
