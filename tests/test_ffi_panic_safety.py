"""Regression for the FFI-panic UB (audit round 5 bug #5).

Since Rust 1.81 a panic crossing an `extern "C"` boundary aborts the
process (was UB before). Either way: a .unwrap() on a poisoned Mutex
or an unexpected None in pyronova_recv / pyronova_send / pyronova_emit_log would
take the whole server down at the worst possible moment.

Fix: each FFI entry point is now a one-line `extern "C"` wrapper that
calls `ffi_catch_unwind` around a safe `_inner` body. On a caught
panic the helper logs via tracing (async, non-blocking) and sets a
Python RuntimeError so the Python caller sees a normal exception.

Structural test: verify the three C-FFI entry points all go through
ffi_catch_unwind. An actual panic test would require triggering a
Rust panic from inside a C callback, which is fiddly; the structural
check stops the wrapper from being accidentally stripped.
