"""Sub-interpreter memory behavior regression tests.

Covers the full leak story from 2026-04-19:

Yesterday's fixes (v1.4.5 security + correctness):
  - Cookie CRLF injection rejection
  - router.lookup case-insensitive
  - Sub-interp accept() errno backoff
  - etc. — see CHANGELOG v1.4.5

Today's fixes (hot-path leak):
  - PyObjRef::Drop uses PyThreadState_GetUnchecked (sub-interp aware)
  - call_handler uses PyObject_Vectorcall (was PyObject_Call)
  - build_request uses PyObject_Vectorcall (was PyObject_Call)
  - build_request does manual Py_DECREF on each arg to compensate the
    _PyObject_MakeTpCall fallback leak

Still open:
  - Per-request dict leak (~2 dicts / request survives despite fixes)
  - Python __del__ does NOT fire in Pyronova sub-interpreters at all
    (confirmed with a pure Python class inside a handler). Likely a
    PEP 684 OWN_GIL finalizer issue.

Instead of restarting a server every test, this module uses one long-
lived server with many small routes that report instrumented counters.
All tests share the same server fixture.
