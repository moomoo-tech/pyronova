"""Regression for the PyErr_Print stderr storm (benchmark-17 audit bug #6).

Before the fix, a Python exception in a sub-interpreter handler ran
`PyErr_Print`, which writes synchronously and unbuffered to the
process's stderr fd. Under a 500k-rps flood that triggered many
exceptions, every worker serialized on the kernel stdio lock and
throughput collapsed.

Now the hot path routes exceptions through `log_and_clear_py_exception`,
which captures the exception string and emits it via Rust's `tracing`
pipeline (non-blocking async writer).

We verify:
  1. The helper exists and is the primary error-reporting path.
  2. Calling a handler that raises an exception does not spam stderr
     (this would be the smoking gun for a regression).
