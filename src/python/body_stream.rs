//! Streaming request body — lets a handler consume `Incoming` body frames
//! as they arrive, without buffering the whole body in memory.
//!
//! Opt-in per route via `@app.post("/path", gil=True, stream=True)`. The
//! accept loop skips `Limited::new().collect()` and instead spawns a feeder
//! task that pushes each body frame into a **bounded** channel; the
//! handler sees `req.stream` as a Python iterator yielding `bytes` chunks
//! and terminating with `StopIteration` on EOF.
//!
//! The channel is `tokio::sync::mpsc` with capacity 8 rather than
//! `std::sync::mpsc` unbounded — the bound propagates backpressure all
//! the way to the TCP stack. If the Python handler is slow (say parsing
//! a 10 GB upload line-by-line), the feeder `.send().await` suspends,
//! which in turn stops `poll_frame` from being driven, and eventually
//! the TCP receive window closes on the client side. No OOM, no silent
//! space leak. The crossover point for "full" is ~8 × typical frame
//! size (~64 KB each) = ~512 KB in flight per connection, which is
//! deliberately modest.
//!
//! Scope (v1):
//!   * Only `gil=True` routes. Sub-interpreter streaming needs a C-FFI
//!     bridge akin to `pyronova_recv`/`pyronova_send` and is deferred.
//!   * Sync iterator only. `async for chunk in req.stream()` is deferred.
//!   * `max_body_size` still bounds total ingest even when streaming.
//!
//! Error handling: if the client disconnects or sends malformed frames,
//! the feeder sends an error message on the channel; `__next__` raises
//! `IOError(msg)` so the handler can terminate cleanly.
