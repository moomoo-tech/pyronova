//! Pyre logging engine — zero-cost tracing with non-blocking I/O.
//!
//! Provides:
//! - `init_logger`: configures tracing-subscriber with non-blocking writer
//! - `emit_python_log`: receives Python `logging` calls via FFI, routes to tracing
//!
//! Key: uses `tracing-appender::non_blocking` to avoid StdoutLock contention.
//! Without this, 220k QPS access log would starve Tokio worker threads on
//! the global stdout mutex.

/// The guard MUST outlive the writer — if dropped, the background I/O
/// thread stops and every subsequent log line is silently lost. Storing
/// the pair atomically in one `OnceLock` is what makes init safe under
/// concurrent `init_logger()` calls: the first caller's pair wins, the
/// loser's pair is dropped together (its guard AND writer, never split).
///
/// Previous design stored only the guard in `OnceLock` and created a
/// fresh `(writer, guard)` tuple on every call; a racing caller could
/// win `try_init()` with its own writer but lose `NB_GUARD.set()`,
/// orphaning the writer because its guard was dropped.
