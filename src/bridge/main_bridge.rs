//! Main-interpreter dispatch bridge for `gil=True` routes under TPC.
//!
//! TPC's default Phase 2 inline handler can only run sub-interpreter-safe
//! code. Legacy C extensions (numpy / pandas / torch / pydantic-core)
//! force `gil=True` on their handlers and require execution on the main
//! interpreter. This bridge makes that compatible with TPC.
//!
//! Architecture:
//!
//!   N TPC threads ──(crossbeam::bounded(cap), MPMC)──▶ M bridge worker threads
//!                            ↑                                          │
//!                            │ bounded, try_send → 503 on full          │ Python::attach
//!                            │                                          │ (main GIL)
//!                            ◀─────────(tokio::sync::oneshot)─────────── ◁
//!                              response via oneshot per request
//!
//! Why M > 1: Python's GIL is a *runtime* lock, not a per-thread one.
//! When a `gil=True` handler does I/O (file read, socket call, sleep,
//! sqlx fetch via `runtime().block_on`) the underlying C call releases
//! the GIL. With a single bridge thread, that I/O blocks the *thread*
//! even though the GIL is free — new GIL work piles up in the channel
//! until it 503s, while the main interp sits idle.
//!
//! With M worker threads, the released GIL is immediately picked up by
//! the next worker. CPU-bound numpy-style handlers still serialize on
//! the GIL (correct), but I/O-bound handlers see real concurrency
//! (limited by the worker count, not by the bridge fan-in width).
//!
//! Worker count defaults to 4 (typical: handlers mix CPU + I/O); set
//! `PYRONOVA_GIL_BRIDGE_WORKERS` to override. Channel capacity defaults
//! to 16 *per worker* so the back-pressure ratio stays the same as the
//! original single-thread design.
//!
//! Throughput contract: the bridge is a *cold path*. CPython's GIL caps
//! parallel CPU at the single-thread rate of whatever the handler's
//! work is (typically ≤ 10k rps for numpy-class workloads, often much
//! less). The channel capacity is deliberately small so that when the
//! bridge is saturated, TPC threads 503 *fast* rather than accumulating
//! memory on a queue that services slower than the fleet's inbound rate.
//! The rest of the fleet (pure sub-interp routes) keeps running at TPC
//! speed — the GIL-bound slowdown stays contained.
//!
//! `dispatch_one` reuses the existing `call_handler_with_hooks` from
//! `handlers.rs` — same semantics as the non-TPC GIL path: before hooks
//! → handler → after hooks → response extraction. Coroutines and
//! streams fall through the same logic.
